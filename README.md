# JavaFX-Game-Application

Introduction : 

This application is a kind of game named “Boooom!” . We are asked to do this by using JavaFX 
framework, which is a set of graphics that programmers use to create complex applications.

In this game, there are 5 levels and each of them includes several types of rectangles. The aim
is to destroy rectangles by considering their durability and clicking as few as possible. When all the
rectangles are destroyed, next level becomes available. The usage of the game will be explained in
more detail in the implementation part.


Implementation :

In this program, there are 6 main classes. One of them is for the main menu, the others are for the levels. When we open project.java class in eclipse and start the program, The main menu is shown like this. At the top of the menu, there is the title which has a constant motion. At left, there is a simple example of a game board. It has a constant motion as well. At right, there are separate buttons to reach the levels one by one. When the previous level is done, the button for the next level becomes active. If we try to reach next level without completing the previous one, A warning text occurs just under of the buttons. When we click a button, a different window arises. For each level, there is a specific stage and window.
